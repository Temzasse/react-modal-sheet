## üì¶ Installation

```sh
npm install react-modal-sheet
```

### Peer dependencies

The gestures and animations are handled by the excellent [Motion](https://motion.dev/) library so before you can start using this library you need to install `motion`:

```sh
npm install motion
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are still using the old `framer-motion` package you need to upgrade to `motion` as `react-modal-sheet` is now built on top of the new `motion` package. **Version `v3.5.0` and older are compatible with `framer-motion`**.

## üíª Usage

```tsx
import { Sheet } from 'react-modal-sheet';
import { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open sheet</button>

      <Sheet isOpen={isOpen} onClose={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <Sheet.Container>
          <Sheet.Header />
          <Sheet.Content>{/* Your sheet content goes here */}</Sheet.Content>
        </Sheet.Container>
        <Sheet.Backdrop />
      </Sheet>
    </>
  );
}
```

The `Sheet` component follows the [Compound Component pattern](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks) in order to provide a flexible yet powerful API for creating highly customizable bottom sheet components.

Since the final bottom sheet is composed from smaller building blocks (`Container`, `Content`, `Scroller`, `Header`, and `Backdrop`) you are in total control over the rendering output. So for example, if you don't want to have any backdrop in your sheet then you can just skip rendering it instead of passing some prop like `renderBackdrop={false}` to the main sheet component. Cool huh? üòé

Also, by constructing the sheet from smaller pieces makes it easier to apply any necessary accessibility related properties to the right components without requiring the main sheet component to be aware of them. You can read more about accessibility in the [Accessibility](#Accessibility) section.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods and properties

### `snapTo(index)`

Imperative method that can be accessed via a ref for snapping to a snap point in given index.

```tsx
import { Sheet, SheetRef } from 'react-modal-sheet';
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';

const snapPoints = [1, 0.5, 0];

function Example() {
  const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);
  const ref = useRef<SheetRef>(null);
  const snapTo = (i: number) => ref.current?.snapTo(i);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open sheet</button>

      {/* Opens to 50% since initial index is 1 */}
      <Sheet
        ref={ref}
        isOpen={isOpen}
        onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
        initialSnap={1}
        snapPoints={snapPoints}
        onSnap={(snapIndex) =>
          console.log('> Current snap point index:', snapIndex)
        }
      >
        <Sheet.Container>
          <Sheet.Content>
            <button onClick={() => snapTo(0)}>Snap to index 0</button>
            <button onClick={() => snapTo(1)}>Snap to index 1</button>
            <button onClick={() => snapTo(2)}>Snap to index 2</button>
            <button onClick={() => snapTo(3)}>Snap to index 3</button>
          </Sheet.Content>
        </Sheet.Container>
      </Sheet>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Motion value `y`

The `y` value is an internal `MotionValue` that represents the distance to the top most position of the sheet when it is fully open. So for example the `y` value is zero when the sheet is completely open.

Similarly to the `snapTo` method the `y` value can be accessed via a ref.

The `y` value can be useful for certain situtation eg. when you want to combine snap points with scrollable sheet content and ensure that the content stays properly scrollable in any snap point. Below you can see a simplified example of this situation and for a more detailed example take a look at the [ScrollableSnapPoints](example/components/ScrollableSnapPoints.tsx) component in the example app.

```tsx
import { Sheet, SheetRef } from 'react-modal-sheet';
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';

const snapPoints = [1, 0.5, 0];

function Example() {
  const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);
  const ref = useRef<SheetRef>(null);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open sheet</button>

      <Sheet
        isOpen={isOpen}
        onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
        initialSnap={1}
        snapPoints={snapPoints}
      >
        <Sheet.Container>
          {/**
           * Since `Sheet.Content` is a `motion.div` it can receive motion values
           * in it's style prop which allows us to utilise the exposed `y` value.
           *
           * By syncing the padding bottom with the `y` motion value we introduce
           * an offset that ensures that the sheet content can be scrolled all the
           * way to the bottom in every snap point.
           */}
          <Sheet.Content style={{ paddingBottom: ref.current?.y }}>
            <Sheet.Scroller draggableAt="both">
              {/* Some content here that makes the sheet content scrollable */}
            </Sheet.Scroller>
          </Sheet.Content>
        </Sheet.Container>
      </Sheet>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Detents

By default the sheet will take the full height of the page minus top padding and safe area inset. If you want the sheet height to be based on it's content you can pass `detent="content-height"` prop to the `Sheet` component:

```tsx
function Example() {
  const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Sheet
      isOpen={isOpen}
      onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
      detent="content-height"
    >
      <Sheet.Container>
        <Sheet.Content>
          <Sheet.Scroller>
            <div style={{ height: 200 }}>Some content</div>
          </Sheet.Scroller>
        </Sheet.Content>
      </Sheet.Container>
    </Sheet>
  );
}
```

If the sheet height changes dynamically the sheet will grow until it hits the maximum full height after which it becomes scrollable.

It is possible to use snap points with `detent="content-height"` **but** the snap points are restricted by the content height. For example if one of the snap points is 800px and the sheet height is only 700px then snapping to the 800px snap point would only snap to 700px since otherwise the sheet would become detached from the bottom.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you are wondering where the term `detent` comes from it's from Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/presentation/sheets#ios-ipados).

## üß© Compound Components

### `Sheet`

Sheet is the root element that wraps the whole sheet. It renders a fixed positioned wrapper element that covers the whole screen to contain the actual sheet that is animated in (don't worry the root element is not interactive when the sheet is closed). All sheet compound components should be rendered within `Sheet`.

> üñ• Rendered element: `motion.div`.

### `Sheet.Container`

Sheet container is positioned above the sheet backdrop and by default adds a small shadow and rounded corners to the sheet. `Sheet.Content` and `Sheet.Header` should be rendered inside `Sheet.Container`.

> üñ• Rendered element: `motion.div`.

### `Sheet.Header`

Sheet header acts as a drag target and has a dragging direction indicator. Rendering any children inside `Sheet.Header` replaces the default header.

#### Header props

| Name          | Required | Default | Description                        |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `disableDrag` | no       | false   | Disable drag for the sheet header. |

### `Sheet.Content`

Sheet content acts as a drag target and can be used in conjunction with `Sheet.Scroller` to make sure that content which doesn't fit inside the sheet becomes scrollable.

#### Content props

| Name          | Required | Default | Description                         |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `disableDrag` | no       | false   | Disable drag for the sheet content. |

### `Sheet.Scroller`

Sheet scroller can be used to make the whole sheet content or parts of it scrollable in a way that drag gestures are properly disabled and enabled based on the scroll state. See the [Scrolling on touch devices](#scrolling-on-touch-devices) section for more details.

| ------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `draggableAt` | no       | `"top"` | Should the drag be enabled when the element is scrolled either to the top, bottom, or both. Available values: `top`, `bottom`, `both`. |

### `Sheet.Backdrop`

Sheet backdrop is a translucent overlay that helps to separate the sheet from it's background. By default the backdrop doesn't have any interaction attached to it but if you, for example, want to close the sheet when the backdrop is clicked you can provide tap handler to it which will change the rendered element from `div` to `button`.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** as the element is a motion component you need to use [`onTap`](https://motion.dev/docs/react-gestures#tap) instead of `onClick` if you want to add a click handler to it.

## ‚ú® Advanced usage

### ‚å®Ô∏è Virtual keyboard avoidance

A common problem with React Modal Sheet is that since the sheet is rendered as a fixed positioned element it doesn't move when the virtual keyboard is opened which can lead to the keyboard covering the input elements.

Handling the virtual keyboard on mobile devices can be quite tricky. It doesn't help that the Web doesn't yet have widely supported APIs for working with the virtual keyboard.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This library does not provide any official built-in solution for keyboard avoidance!**

This is because it is not possible for the library to know how your sheet content is structured and how the sheet should behave when the keyboard is opened.

However, there are some strategies that you can use to handle the virtual keyboard:

1. Design your sheet content in a way that the input elements are positioned at the top of the sheet so that they are not covered by the keyboard. This is the easiest solution and if you look at popular mobile apps you can see that they often have input elements at the top of the screen exactly for this reason.

2. Listen to changes in the `visualViewport`, see [Visual Viewport API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Visual_Viewport_API), and change styles like padding on the sheet content to move the input up when the keyboard is opened. See the `AvoidKeyboard` component [code](example/components/AvoidKeyboard.tsx) and [demo](https://temzasse.github.io/react-modal-sheet/#/avoid-keyboard) in the example app for a simple example of this. The example is based on a custom `useAnimatedVirtualKeyboard` hook which you can copy to your project at your own risk. **Note that at least on iOS there is a noticeable delay when the keyboard is opened and when the `resize` event is fired for the `visualViewport`**.

3. Use the experimental [VirtualKeyboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VirtualKeyboard_API) to detect when the virtual keyboard is opened and adjust the sheet content accordingly. **Note that this API is not yet widely supported in browsers, but it will most likely produce the best result.**

### üì± Scrolling on touch devices

Scrolling and dragging are **the same** gesture on touch devices which can create problems when you want to have scrollable content inside the sheet. React Modal Sheet provides a `Sheet.Scroller` component that is able to automatically disable and enable dragging inside the `Sheet.Content` component based on the scroll state. There are three modes for the `Sheet.Scroller` reflected in the `draggableAt` prop:

1. Enable dragging when the scroller is not yet scrolled - it is at the `top` position.
2. Enable dragging when the scroller is scrolled all the way to the bottom - it is at the `bottom` position.
3. Enable dragging in `both` positions.

The scroller component is in-between these states when the user has scrolled only some amount. Dragging is always **disabled** in this in-between state in order to avoid it getting mixed with dragging gestures. The `Sheet.Scroller` component applies the special handling only for touch devices.

The default value for the `draggableAt` prop is `top` which should be a good default for most use cases. You shouldn't need `bottom` or `both` unless you have scrollable content inside a sheet that also has snap points.

```tsx
function ScrollableExample() {
  return (
    <Sheet>
      <Sheet.Container>
        <Sheet.Header />
        <Sheet.Content>
          <Sheet.Scroller>{/*...*/}</Sheet.Scroller>
        </Sheet.Content>
      </Sheet.Container>
      <Sheet.Backdrop />
    </Sheet>
  );
}
```

### ü™ü iOS Modal View effect

In addition to the `Sheet.Backdrop` it's possible to apply a scaling effect to the main app element to highlight the modality of the bottom sheet. This effect mimics the [iOS Modal View](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/modality/) presentation style to bring more focus to the sheet and add some delight to the user experience.

| ![](media/3.gif) | ![](media/4.gif) |
| :--------------: | :--------------: |

To enable this effect you can provide the id of the root element where your application is mounted:

```tsx
function Example() {
  return <Sheet modalEffectRootId="root">{/*...*/}</Sheet>;
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**: Since the effect is applied to the root element it will NOT work as desired if the HTML body element is scrolled down at all. One way to avoid this is to use something like `height: 100vh;` and `overflow: auto;` on the root element to make it fill the whole screen and be scrollable instead of the body element. You can check the example apps [root styles](https://github.com/Temzasse/react-modal-sheet/blob/main/example/src/index.css) for a working example of this.

#### Controlling the effect

You can control the start threshold of the effect with the `modalEffectThreshold` prop which should have a value between `0` and `1` representing the fraction at which the effect starts relative to the dragging distance. So for example, a value of `0.5` means the effect will start when the sheet is dragged halfway and `0.7` would mean the effect will start when the sheet is dragged 70% of the way to the top. The default value is `0` which means that the effect will start as soon as the sheet is opened or dragged into view.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using `snapPoints` the start threshold is calculated based on the
> second snap point so that when the sheet is snapping to the first snap point,
> meaning the sheet is fully open, the effect will only apply for that snap point
> range and not for the whole draggable distance.
>
> This gives a more natural UX and follows the native iOS effect more closely.
>
> You can still override this behavior by providing a custom `modalEffectThreshold` value.

## üé® Customization

The default styles for the `Sheet` component somewhat follows the styles of the previously mentioned iOS Modal View. However, if these default styles are not to your liking it's easy to make changes to them: you can provide a custom header or you can overwrite any style with CSS via the exposed class names.

### Custom header

Adding a custom header is as simple as providing your own header as the child component to `Sheet.Header`:

```tsx
function Example() {
  return (
    <Sheet>
      <Sheet.Container>
        <Sheet.Header>
          <YourCustomSheetHeader />
        </Sheet.Header>
        <Sheet.Content>{/*...*/}</Sheet.Content>
      </Sheet.Container>
      <Sheet.Backdrop />
    </Sheet>
  );
}
```

### Custom styles

You can add your own styles or override the default sheet styles via the exposed class names. Note that you might need to use `!important` for style overrides since the inner styles are applied as inline styles which have higher specificity.

#### Vanilla CSS

```css
.react-modal-sheet-backdrop {
  /* custom styles */
}
.react-modal-sheet-container {
  /* custom styles */
}
.react-modal-sheet-header {
  /* custom styles */
}
.react-modal-sheet-drag-indicator {
  /* custom styles */
}
.react-modal-sheet-content {
  /* custom styles */
}
```

#### CSS-in-JS

```tsx
import { Sheet } from 'react-modal-sheet';
import { styled } from 'styled-components';
import { useState } from 'react';

const CustomSheet = styled(Sheet)`
  .react-modal-sheet-backdrop {
    /* custom styles */
  }
  .react-modal-sheet-container {
    /* custom styles */
  }
  .react-modal-sheet-header {
    /* custom styles */
  }
  .react-modal-sheet-drag-indicator {
    /* custom styles */
  }
  .react-modal-sheet-content {
    /* custom styles */
  }
`;

function Example() {
  const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open sheet</button>

      <CustomSheet isOpen={isOpen} onClose={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <Sheet.Container>
          <Sheet.Header />
          <Sheet.Content>{/*...*/}</Sheet.Content>
        </Sheet.Container>
        <Sheet.Backdrop />
      </CustomSheet>
    </>
  );
}
```

## ‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility

By default, react-modal-sheet doesn't include any built-in accessibility properties in order to not make any assumptions and to support a wide range of use cases. Additionally, not including 3rd party libraries for features like focus trapping or screen reader support makes it possible to utilize any accessibility libraries that your project may already use, eg. [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/getting-started.html). This also helps to reduce JS bloat by not including similar libraries multiple times in your app bundle.

The example below utilizes React Aria to achieve an accessible modal-like bottom sheet that can be closed via a button rendered inside a custom sheet header.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The example was built by following the React Aria's [useDialog](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useDialog.html) documentation.

```tsx
import { Sheet } from 'react-modal-sheet';
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { useOverlayTriggerState } from 'react-stately';

import {
  useOverlay,
  useModal,
  OverlayProvider,
  FocusScope,
  useButton,
  useDialog,
} from 'react-aria';

function A11yExample() {
  const sheetState = useOverlayTriggerState({});
  const openButtonRef = useRef(null);
  const openButton = useButton({ onPress: sheetState.open }, openButtonRef);

  return (
    <div>
      <button {...openButton.buttonProps} ref={openButtonRef}>
        Open sheet
      </button>

      <Sheet isOpen={sheetState.isOpen} onClose={sheetState.close}>
        <OverlayProvider>
          <FocusScope contain autoFocus restoreFocus>
            <SheetComp sheetState={sheetState} />
          </FocusScope>
        </OverlayProvider>
      </Sheet>
    </div>
  );
}

function SheetComp({ sheetState }) {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  const dialog = useDialog({}, containerRef);
  const overlay = useOverlay(
    { onClose: sheetState.close, isOpen: true, isDismissable: true },
    containerRef
  );

  const closeButtonRef = useRef(null);
  const closeButton = useButton(
    { onPress: sheetState.close, 'aria-label': 'Close sheet' },
    closeButtonRef
  );

  useModal();

  // In real world usage this would be a separate React component
  const customHeader = (
    <div>
      <span {...dialog.titleProps}>Some title for sheet</span>
      <button {...closeButton.buttonProps}>üÖß</button>
    </div>
  );

  return (
    <>
      <Sheet.Container
        {...overlay.overlayProps}
        {...dialog.dialogProps}
        ref={containerRef}
      >
        <Sheet.Header>{customHeader}</Sheet.Header>
        <Sheet.Content>{/*...*/}</Sheet.Content>
      </Sheet.Container>
      <Sheet.Backdrop />
    </>
  );
}
```

If you want to see a more real-world-like implementation you can take a look at the [Slack example](example/components/slack-message/index.tsx) and try out the related [demo](https://temzasse.github.io/react-modal-sheet/#/slack-message) (optimized for mobile).

### üî© Building a reusable sheet

In your projects it might make sense to build a reusable bottom sheet that has all the accessibility features included and can then be easily used in various places in the project. Take a look at the [A11ySheet](example/components/a11y/A11ySheet.tsx) example to get some insight on how to build such a component. By incorporating all the accessibility features inside your own reusable component you don't need to repeat them every time you want to use a bottom sheet in your app.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### The sheet doesn't open when using `StrictMode`

If you are using React [StrictMode](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode) the sheet animations might not work as expected. This seems to be an issue in the `motion` library and I haven't been able to find a good solution for it yet. You see all `motion` issues related to the `StrictMode` [here](https://github.com/motiondivision/motion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+StrictMode). Easiest solution is to just not to use `StrictMode` ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
